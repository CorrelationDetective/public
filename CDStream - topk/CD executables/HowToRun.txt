The jar in this folder provide all necessary functionality to reproduce the experiments of CDStream topk

The jar can be run as follows:

java -cp <name of jar> main <algorithm> <data path> <arrival times path> <n> <l_max> <r_max> <tau> <delta> <k>


Notes:

 - the data should be in CSV format, with a header row indicating the name of each time series. There should be no index column. E.g.:

MSFT, AAPL, ASML, ...
200, 3000, 500, ...
202, 2950, 550, ...
...

 - the arrival tives should be in have rows of comma-separated integers, starting with the name of the vector it refers to. E.g.:

MSFT,1,6,7,8,...
AAPL,2,5,7,8,...
ASML,1,2,3,4,...

...

- algorithm should be one of:
	- streaming (to run CDStream base)
	- oneshot (to run CD)

- n indicates the amount of vectors that should be used from the data
- tau indicates the correlation threshold
- to run with irreducibility, set delta = 0. To run with no constraint, set delta to something negative (e.g. -5)

The parameters of the experiment in the paper were:
- algorithm 	= several runs with each of the available
- data		= stocks
- n 		= 1000
- l_max 	= 1
- r_max 	= 2
- tau		= 0.8
- delta 	= 0.05
- k		= [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]
